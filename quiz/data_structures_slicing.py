# Python Data Structures and Slicing Challenge

# Given Data:
my_list = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
my_tuple = (5, 15, 25, 35, 45)
my_dict = {'name': 'John', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}

# 1. Print the third element from the list.
print(my_list[2])
# 2. Print the last element from the tuple.
print(my_tuple[4])
# 3. Print the value associated with the key 'age' from the dictionary.
print(my_dict['age'])
# 4. Use slicing to print the first three elements from the list.
print(my_list[:3])
# 5. Use negative indexing to print the last two elements from the tuple.
print(my_tuple[-2:])
